# Web-Photos-Gallery

It's a simple web gallery written in HTML, CSS and JQuery

## How to use

- Add your photo inside **static > images** and name the photo in this way **'1.png'** for example.
  If you have more than one photo you have to call your images following an increasing numerical order.

- Then update the variable **length** inside the **slider.js** file with the current number of photos inside
  the **images** folder.

- then open the **index.html** file to see the result

### TODO

1. Dinamically update the number of the photo
1. Avoid the numerical order naming of the image
